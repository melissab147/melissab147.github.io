I am a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Colorado Boulder. My research area is Human-Centered Computing. I am part of Project EPIC (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) working with Professor Leysia Palen. My research interests are in crisis informatics, social computing, information diffusion, and data visualization.

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Santa Clara University.  My interest in human-centered computing comes from several of my experiences throughout college, including training rural women in IT skills in India, developing a mobile app for local homeless people in the Bay Area, and leading a group of high school girls as they learned programming and mobile development.

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:
    
    title : Melissa's Website =)
    
    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.
    
## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.
