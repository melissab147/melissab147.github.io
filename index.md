I am a first year Ph.D. student at University of Colorado Boulder in Computer Science within the research area of Human-Centered Computing. I am part of Project EPIC (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) working with Professor Leysia Palen. This year, I am a TA for Introduction to Programming, and I intend to start research in Crisis Informatics this fall.

In June 2014, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Santa Clara University.  My interest in HCC/HCI comes from several of my experiences throughout college, including training rural women in IT skills in India, developing a mobile app for local homeless people in the Bay Area, and leading a group of high school girls as they learned programming and mobile development. I enjoy participating in community outreach and educating younger students, especially girls, about STEM fields. Overall, I strive to become a socially conscious computer engineer focusing on humanitarian technology.

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:
    
    title : Melissa's Website =)
    
    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.
    
## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.
