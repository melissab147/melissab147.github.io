<h3> Image Diffusion Through Social Media During Disaster </h3>
<p>
	I am currently working on a research project focusing on how images diffuse through social media and what kinds of visual information are important to different people during and after disasters. Working with a set of over 1 million tweets containing images collected during the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake in April 2015, I am creating visualizations to show trends and patterns in the data based on image content and other tweet metadata. Based on previous work done by others working in Project EPIC on textual Twitter data, I expect to see differences in images posted by people local to the earthquake versus the global public.

<h3> News and the Social Life of Disaster Images </h3>

<p>
	I recently contributed to a <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/data/entries/news-and-the-social-life-of-disaster-images">submission to the Knight Foundation News Challenge</a> on how to make data work for individuals and communities. Our project focuses on what journalists can learn from how images of disaster spread through social media. To better inform news reporting on disaster and fuel stories for the Between Fire and Ice transmedia journalism project at CU Boulder, this interdisciplinary collaboration will statistically analyze how images spread through social media during disasters, examine why certain images circulate more widely than others, and identify what kinds of images are valuable to the local community versus a global public.

<h3> Interactive Visual Data Mining </h3>

<p>
	Social media data provide insight into peopleâ€™s opinions, thoughts, and reactions about real-world events. However, this data is often analyzed at a shallow level with simple visual representations, making much of this insight undiscoverable. Our approach to this problem was to create a framework for visual data mining that enables users to find implicit patterns and relationships within their data, focus- ing particularly on flock phenomena in social media. Ren- dezview is an interactive visualization framework that con- sists of three visual components: a spatiotemporal 3D map, a word cloud, and a Sankey flow diagram. These compo- nents provide individual functions for data exploration and interoperate with each other based on user interaction. The current version of Rendezview can represent local topics and their co-occurrence relationships from geo-tagged Twitter messages. This research was done at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Tsukuba, Japan as part of the OSDC PIRE Fellowship.
